# Zhiye Fusion - Main Program

#### Program Name

**Zhiye (支叶):**

- 32-bit runtime environment: `nlu_run_32bit` (memory-efficient)
- 64-bit runtime environment: `nlu_run_64bit` (supports double precision, long integer data, and integration with platforms like OpenCV and Ollama)
- Third-party C/C++ library example project: `dll_nlu3`

#### Introduction

The Zhiye program begins as a seed, growing roots and branches through human interaction, continuously learning knowledge and ideas.
 It can assist humans with intellectual tasks (this capability requires user teaching or knowledge-sharing). When integrated with server-side resources, it can master unlimited knowledge.
 In the future, it will become an indispensable super assistant for every individual.

#### Runtime Environments

Data centers, large-scale servers, personal computers, smartphones, automotive systems, and intelligent robots.

#### Usage Instructions

1. Double-click to run the main program `zhiye.exe`.
2. Enter the password `1234`.
3. Input Chinese content to interact (you can directly define functions or inject functionality via C/C++ programs). For more tutorials, follow "Zhiye Cognition" (Kuaishou, Douyin/TikTok).

#### C++ Library Integration Guide

1. Load libraries using the internal `loadlib` function and release them with `unload` (example code: "Natural Language Understanding NLU - Third-Party Function Integration").

#### Special Notes

1. Zhiye can be taught using natural language or machine-language definitions (via scripts or C/C++ programs).
2. All C/C++ functions and script functions in Zhiye can be executed by referencing their names. Parameters are placed in parentheses after the function name; parentheses may be omitted for single-parameter functions. All functions support overloading.
3. During execution, all parameters and variables can be used directly without type declaration (types are inferred upon assignment, similar to Python).
4. Zhiye has continuous learning capabilities. It starts with minimal predefined rules and develops its logic through human interaction—the more it is used, the better it understands users.
5. During public testing, skills and knowledge acquired by Zhiye belong to the user.
6. Zhiye lacks behavioral judgment capabilities. **Users shall bear full responsibility** for all consequences arising from teaching it to perform illegal actions.
